- follow the "add remote origin" steps if need be
	- now you have a local copy to work with
git checkout -b development_branch_name
- let everyone know on slack which files you are
going to work on! Then you can work on them!
- git add, git commit all the time!

BEFORE MERGING:
- git add . (to your production branch)
- git commit -m "description of what you worked on"

MERGE TO MASTER:
- git checkout master
- git pull origin master (fast-forward hopefully!)
- git merge development_branch_name
- resolve conflicts
- if conflicts, git commit
- git push origin master (fast-forward hopefully!)
- delete working branch (git branch -D development_branch_name)
start working again!
- git checkout master
- git pull origin master
- git checkout -b new_dev_branch
